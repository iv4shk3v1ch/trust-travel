## 🎯 **MUCH BETTER ORGANIZED PROJECT STRUCTURE!**

### 📁 **New Clean Architecture:**

```
src/
├── app/                    # Next.js App Router (pages & API routes)
│   ├── (auth)/            # Auth-related pages
│   ├── api/               # API routes
│   └── ...pages
│

│   ├── types/             # Shared TypeScript types

└── core/                  # ⚙️ CORE INFRASTRUCTURE
    ├── database/          # All database logic centralized
    └── services/          # Core services (AI, etc.)
```

### ✨ **Benefits of New Structure:**

#### 🎯 **Feature-Based Organization**
- Each feature is self-contained
- Easy to find related code
- Clear boundaries between features

#### 🔄 **Shared vs Feature-Specific**
- Reusable components in `/shared`
- Feature-specific logic in `/features`
- No more guessing where components belong

#### ⚙️ **Core Infrastructure**
- All database logic centralized in `/core/database`
- Services like AI in `/core/services`
- Clean separation of concerns

#### 📦 **Clean Imports**
- `@/features/auth` for auth-related code
- `@/shared/components` for UI components
- `@/core/database` for database operations

### 🚀 **Next Steps Needed:**
1. Update remaining import paths
2. Fix component exports/imports
3. Test authentication flow
4. Verify all features work

**This structure is MUCH more maintainable and scalable!** 🎉
